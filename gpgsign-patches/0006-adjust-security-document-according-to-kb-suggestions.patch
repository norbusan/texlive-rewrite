-Transition notes:
-* I would like to have a start on this already *before*
-  2016, but during 2015 we would have:
-  - if gpg is not available, or remote .sha256.gpg is not
-    available, silently continue (same behaviour as now)
-  After 2016 I suggest that if either of the above two
-  fail (gpg not available, or remote .sha256.gpg not
-  found), then tlmgr stops - unless --no-verification is
-  passed in or set in the tlmgr configuration file.
-* At least till after 2016 is released we need to generate
-  both texlvie.tlpdb.md5 and .sha256 on the remote server,
-  otherwise updates from versions before cannot verify
-  (hmm, maybe they can - as we do not break if there is
-  no md5 sum available - so maybe this is not necessary
-  at all and we can simply switch without any problem!)
-* gpg binaries:
-  for windows I guess we have to ship it, for all others
-  we should be able to assume that it is there. Those
-  who do not have access to gpg need to set --no-verification
-  in the configuration file.
+Usage:
+* if gpg is found, try to use it, otherwise just
+  give warning about how to verify/gpg necessary
+* only if gpg is available, download .sha256.asc and
+  verify
