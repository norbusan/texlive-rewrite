 Security Proposal for TeX Live

 It would make sense to replace some or all of the above with sha256.
 2) is the only one we could keep as md5, but I propose that if
-we switch, then we switch all the md5 to sha256.

+	I made changes that 2) remains as MD5 (tl_short_digest)
+	so that the generated filenames are not exorbitant long
+	(like for sha512).
 
 In principle my idea about security setup is as follows:
 
 For the installer
-* installer packages are sha256 hashed (already done!)
-* the sha256 files are gpg signed with our gpg tlnet key
+* installer packages are sha512 hashed (already done!)
+* the sha512 files are gpg signed with our gpg tlnet key
 * our public gpg key is included in texlive.infra package
 
 For the rest (installation or update from remote)
-* install-tl/tlmgr downloads the texlive.sha256.gpg and
-  texlive.sha256
+* install-tl/tlmgr downloads the texlive.checksum.gpg and
+  texlive.checksum
 * verifies that this is ok
-* if yes, download the texlive.tlpdb and check the sha256
+* if yes, download the texlive.tlpdb and check the checksum
   value of it (this is the reason we should switch from
-  md5 to sha256, as md5 is AFAIR fakeable)
+  md5 to sha512, as md5 is AFAIR fakeable)
 * if all succeed, do the usual verification of each
-  container only by sha256 (instead of md5)
+  container only by sha512 (instead of md5)
 
 There is no need to sign each container, as we are having
-indirectly signed sha256 hashes of the containers
-(in the tlpdb, which is sha256-ed, and then signed).
+indirectly signed sha512 hashes of the containers
+(in the tlpdb, which is sha512-ed, and then signed).
 
 Usage:
 * if gpg is found, try to use it, otherwise just
   give warning about how to verify/gpg necessary
-* only if gpg is available, download .sha256.asc and
+* only if gpg is available, download .sha512.asc and
   verify
